## Lecture 1 - Introduction

Computers do two things:

- Perform calculations
- Store results

Declarative vs. Imperative knowledge:

- Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge
- Imperative knowledge is HOW to do something

A program is a sequence of <u>definitions</u> (which are evaluated) and <u>commands</u> (which are executed).

## Lecture 2 - Branching and Iteration

Starts with **string concatenation**, and using `print` function with comma or + concatenation

**Control flow** branching and boolean truth tables.

|       |      |       |       |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| True  | and  | True  | True  |
| True  | and  | False | False |
| False | and  | True  | False |
| False | and  | False | False |
| True  |  or  | True  | True  |
| True  |  or  | False | True  |
| False |  or  | True  | True  |
| False |  or  | False | False |

**While loops** and **for loops**, range function and break statements

- Use `for` loops when number of iterations are known, `while` loops when this is not known
- Can use `while` loop in place of a  `for` loop but not vice versa
