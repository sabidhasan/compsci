## Lecture 1 - Introduction

Computers do two things:

- Perform calculations
- Store results

Declarative vs. Imperative knowledge:

- Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge
- Imperative knowledge is HOW to do something

A program is a sequence of <u>definitions</u> (which are evaluated) and <u>commands</u> (which are executed).

## Lecture 2 - Branching and Iteration

Starts with **string concatenation**, and using `print` function with comma or + concatenation

**Control flow** branching and boolean truth tables.

|       |      |       |       |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| True  | and  | True  | True  |
| True  | and  | False | False |
| False | and  | True  | False |
| False | and  | False | False |
| True  |  or  | True  | True  |
| True  |  or  | False | True  |
| False |  or  | True  | True  |
| False |  or  | False | False |

**While loops** and **for loops**, range function and break statements

- Use `for` loops when number of iterations are known, `while` loops when this is not known
- Can use `while` loop in place of a  `for` loop but not vice versa

## String Manipulation and Basic Algorithms

String functions and manipulation: **len()**, square bracket notation for slicing and substrings

**Immutability**: a string object cannot be modified once created

**Guess and Check** algorithm:

​	A guess and check algorithm is basically brute force. For a cube root finder, loop through all 	numbers until the desired answer is found.

**Approximate Solution** algorithm:

​	The major characteristic of the approximate algorithm solution is an **epsilon** value and a **delta** 	We keep increasing the current guess by the delta, until we run out of guesses or an answer   	within epsilon is reached.	

**Bisection** (or **Binary**) search:

​	search midway, if too high then eliminate upper half of the search space. Otherwise,			    	eliminate lower half of the serach space. Continue until search space runs out or answer is      	found.
