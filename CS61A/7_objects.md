## Lecture 16 - Object Oriented Programming

Computation using distributed state - state is kept in objects akin to the closures.



- Method calls as *messages* between objects

- **Classes** vs **Instances**

- Python distinguishes between **bound methods** and **functions** - methods are pre-filled in with the `self` argument



OOP represents **is-a** relationships, so child classes *should be* a type of their parent classes.

The **method resolution order** determines the order in which method resolution is determined for an object.
