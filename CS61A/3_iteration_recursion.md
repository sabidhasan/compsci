# Lecture 6 - Iteration

A `return` statement comlpetes the evaluation of a call expression, and provides its value back in the original environment.

Only one return statement is executed in a function body.



**Self Reference**

A function can refer to its own name in its body, thus making a higher order function self referential.



**Currying**

Transform multiple-argument functions into a chain of single-argument, higher order functions. Useful when dealing with functions that take only single-argument functions.
