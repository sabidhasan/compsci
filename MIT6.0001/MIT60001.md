## Lecture 1 - Introduction

Computers do two things:

- Perform calculations
- Store results

Declarative vs. Imperative knowledge:

- Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge
- Imperative knowledge is HOW to do something

A program is a sequence of <u>definitions</u> (which are evaluated) and <u>commands</u> (which are executed).

## Lecture 2 - Branching and Iteration

Starts with **string concatenation**, and using `print` function with comma or + concatenation

**Control flow** branching and boolean truth tables.

|       |      |       |       |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| True  | and  | True  | True  |
| True  | and  | False | False |
| False | and  | True  | False |
| False | and  | False | False |
| True  |  or  | True  | True  |
| True  |  or  | False | True  |
| False |  or  | True  | True  |
| False |  or  | False | False |

**While loops** and **for loops**, range function and break statements

- Use `for` loops when number of iterations are known, `while` loops when this is not known
- Can use `while` loop in place of a  `for` loop but not vice versa

## Lecture 3- String Manipulation and Basic Algorithms

String functions and manipulation: **len()**, square bracket notation for slicing and substrings

**Immutability**: a string object cannot be modified once created

**Guess and Check** algorithm:

- A guess and check algorithm is basically brute force. For a cube root finder, loop through all numbers until the desired answer is found.

**Approximate Solution** algorithm:

- The major characteristic of the approximate algorithm solution is an **epsilon** value and a **delta**. We keep increasing the current guess by the delta, until we run out of guesses or an answer within epsilon is reached.		

**Bisection** (or **Binary**) search:

- Search midway, if too high then eliminate upper half of the search space. Otherwise,			    eliminate lower half of the serach space. Continue until search space runs out or answer is found.



## Lecture 4 - Decomposition, Abstraction and Functions

**Decomposition**: construct complex functionality from smaller portions - creating organization in your code

**Abstraction**: abstract away the details for a method - make into black box - suppressing unnecessary details

Functions have:

- **Name**
- **Parameters**, or **arguments** (0 or more)
- **Docstring** - (optional) describes how to use the function; provides abstraction
- **Body** - the code for the function; Python functions start with `def`
- Return value (optional; if not included then `return None` is added)

Function **scope**: making a function call creates a new scope. This scope is discarded when the function call is complete.

Scoping rules dictate that a function creates a local scope for itself before anything else (if `x` is declared in function *and* outside it, the outside `x` will not be affected by the inside `x`). However, the function *can* access a global variable if it doesn't have a variable with the same name as the global variable. LEGB scoping rule for Python: 

- Local
- Enclosed
- Global
- Built-in

## Lecture 5 - Tuples, Lists, Mutability and Cloning

Compound data types are made up of other data types

**Tuples** - contain immutable complex elements. Used for **swapping variables**, or to return **multiple values** from a function. Tuple destructuring

**Lists** - similar to tuples, but mutable. Accessing by index, *append* method and *extend* method. Concatenation using + operator. Remove elements *remove* method and *pop* method. *Sort* (for sorting in place), *sorted* (for creating a sorted copy) and the *reverse* methods. Using *for loops* for looping over list elements.

Splitting strings to lists (`list(str)`), string *join* method

Lists are mutable - when you copy them by `a = b` then `b` is only an alias to the original list. Shallow copy a list by `b = a[:]`. This is called **aliasing**.



## Lecture 6 - Recursion and Dictionaries

**Recursion** - repeating items in a self-repeating way. The opposite of recursion is an **iterative** algorithm (such as `for` or `while` loops). Recusion is a **divide and conquer** algorithm. Reduce a complex problem to: (a very easy problem + slightly simpler problem). Critical to have a **base case** - to prevent infinite recursion.

Examples for recursion: Factorial / multiplication / Fibonacci sequence

**Dictionaries** and iterables (such as range function or `dict.keys()`). Python dictionary keys need to be immutable.

Dictionaries permit **memoization**.



## Lecture 7 - Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, and Assertions

Three classes of tests:

- **Unit tests** - each function runs according to specification
- **Regression tests** - add tests for new bugs to test suite (so new fixes don't introduce the same bug as was previously solved)
- **Integration tests** - does the program as a whole work
- **Blackbox testing** - testing based on just function's docstring
- **Glassbox testing** - writing tests to functions based on code (test extremes, edge cases, etc.)

**Exception** are errors that occur at runtime. Python offers exception **handlers** (`try/except` blocks).

**Assertions** - assert statements exist in functions to state that expectations of what is coming into the function are what they should be. If an assertion fails, the function does not continue.

```python
def func():
	assert not len(some_list) == 0, 'message to print if fails'
  # do something else
```

## Lecture 8 - Object Oriented Programming

Everything is an object in Python. Objects are **data abstractions**. It's key to have abstraction because implementation details are trivial, but objects provide **decomposition** and **abstraction** via giving:

1. **Internal representation** (data for representing - attributes)
2. **Interface** (how to interact with an object - methods)

Garbage collection - garbage collector reclaims "dead" objects to reclaim memory.

**Classes** and the difference between creating a class and instantiating a class, to make instance variables:

```python
class Coordinate(object):
	def __init__(self, x):
		self.x = x
```

Special methods such as:

- `__str__`
- `__init__`
- `__add__`  and `__sub__` and`__eq__`

The `isinstance()` special builtin function gets whether an object is an instance of a class.
